# TheProjectProject

A real-time competitive coding platform where developers can go head-to-head in solving programming challenges.

### The Story
While waiting for ASU’s Sunhacks 2025 to start, our team of three computer science students was joking around to pass the time. Then our teammate Abhronil Dutta cracked a joke about “PvP LeetCode” — because, let’s be honest, CS majors and their egos go hand in hand. And just like that, our hackathon idea was born.

We didn’t manage to finish in time to submit our project, but this repo is the result of our late-night coding, caffeine, and questionable sense of humor.
